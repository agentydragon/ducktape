# Debundler — Open Work Items

Forward-looking gaps in the Rust debundler. Items are written to be removed
once closed; this file is not a changelog.

## Current AI-worker priority queue (2026-09-24)

This file is the dispatch queue, not a design record or changelog. Detailed
plans and evidence live here:

- <docs/selector_resolution.md> — how selectors resolve, and the measured reason
  the architecture is shaped that way.
- <plans/relational_selectors.md> — the remaining selector-language work.
- <plans/automated_spec_workflows.md> — automation-first CLI/workflow design,
  including version porting.
- <plans/factor_vocabulary_rename.md> — "factor" terminology rename (P3).
- <SELECTOR_BUGS.md> — matcher/diagnostic bugs with anonymized examples.
- <ARCHITECTURE_BACKLOG.md> — deeper refactors, urgent only when they block this
  queue.
- `perf/` — measured performance notes. Update from real
  profiles before major matcher/index rewrites.

Planning hygiene: keep active dispatch order here. When a plan's core work is
complete, summarize only its remaining tail here instead of leaving the plan as
a second priority queue.

### P0 — version porting

Carry a spec across bundle versions: <plans/automated_spec_workflows.md>
§ Flow 3, with the held-out `debundle_stabilize` evaluation built on it.

### P1 — automation product flows over the solver

Design and milestones: <plans/automated_spec_workflows.md> — patch-plan bulk
codemods that explain every skipped candidate and prove through the one
resolve, repair from the keep-going report, the inventory/plan/apply/validate
CLI model, and new-app bootstrap. Every flow is held to the interactive budget
in <docs/selector_resolution.md> § Interactive budget.

1. **Selector diagnostics.** Sharper first-mismatch reasons for `no_match`'s
   `nearest_unclaimed`: the first unmatched item of a multi-declaration range,
   the first incompatible identifier binding or sub-expression, a
   parameter-pattern mismatch, and list-hole binding spans; and near misses
   for multi-statement templates.
2. **Selector-debt ranking improvements.** Extend `debundle spec selector-debt`
   with source-aware ranking for multi-statement windows and "stable literal by
   value" candidates. Prefer output that can feed the patch-plan dry-run.
3. **Cross-module binding groups.** `source_matches[]` entries export every
   binding of one matched context into one logical module. Design a form for
   one matched context whose bindings land in different modules, without
   repeating the selector body.

### P1 — test infrastructure

1. **Public real-bundle smoke.** Build the Excalidraw live-browser smoke
   (§ Excalidraw live-browser smoke) so private-corpus debundler issues can be
   reproduced and protected in public CI.
2. **Ground selector-stabilization skill fixtures.** Add tested, anonymized
   fixtures for the common anchor-choice cases of the `debundle_stabilize`
   playbook so its guidance is executable rather than only prose.

### P2 — pipeline performance and architecture cleanup

Proposer-gate, `debundle run` (report opt-out, chunk-level incremental
rebuilds, codegen cache), and materialize-stage performance work lives in
<perf/proposer.md>.

1. `JsChunk::{get_file,get_file_mut,remove_file}` (`artifact.rs`) are linear
   scans over `files`, so passes that touch every file go O(n²) per chunk.
   Replace them with a path-keyed index if fresh profiles show chunk file
   lookup hot.
2. `split_entry_body` (`lowering/lower.rs`) clones every retained statement out
   of the chunk AST even though the chunk body is replaced wholesale afterward.
   Move it to a draining/move-based split if fresh profiles show
   retained-statement cloning hot.

### P3 — read-off minimizer polish

1. **Dogfood-apply on the private downstream repo.** Run `synthesize-selectors --apply` on
   the real spec to convert the large set of fragile name-pins into robust
   `source_match` selectors, review for over-pin, and PR the beneficial ones.
   Revert any converted selector whose `match` block is >40 lines and has <=2
   holes back to a name pin. Keep pin-compatible with the released debundler
   expected by the downstream corpus validation flow, regenerate goldens, and
   re-measure selector debt after each batch.
2. **Retire the keep-shallow group cover.** Multi-target var binding-group
   read-off landed, but `minimize_var_group_selector` still falls back to
   `collect_expr_anchors` plus `AnchorCandidates` for groups whose per-slot
   single-binding view cannot single a slot out. Remove that path after
   tuple-aware read-off covers the residual groups, or deliberately accept them
   as selector debt.
3. **Hole declaration neighbors in enclosing-context anchoring.** When
   `render_via_neighbor_context` anchors a near-duplicate target to a stable
   neighboring function/class declaration, it still pins the neighbor's body
   verbatim. Reuse the per-form read-off to hole the neighbor name/params/body
   and keep only its discriminating value anchor. Ignored expectation fixture:
   `neighbor_context_whole_function_neighbor`.
4. **Route class-expression initializers through class read-off.**
   `try_var_read_off` still has no `Expr::Class` arm, so `const X = class {…}`
   can be pinned whole while the equivalent class declaration minimizes via
   class-body holing. Ignored expectation fixture:
   `class_expression_const_whole_body`.
5. **Undo-log alpha bindings in the matcher.** `selector_match`'s `Bindings`
   (a stack of `AlphaScope` frames of `HashMap`s) is cloned to snapshot before
   each backtracking alternative. If fresh profiles of whole-spec
   `synthesize-selectors --apply` show that cloning hot, replace
   clone-on-snapshot with an undo log and switch the maps to `FxHashMap`.
6. **Skip neighbor-borrowed uniqueness.** When a candidate's uniqueness comes
   only from a non-target neighbor (the target's own body fully holed, a
   neighboring declaration pinned), skip it with a reason instead of reporting
   `would_change`. Key the check on that property, not on selector length:
   neighbor-borrows as short as two lines slip under the >40-line over-pin
   heuristic.
7. **Say why a `--candidates N` menu is short.** `synthesize-selectors
--candidates N` returning one candidate does not say whether only one anchor
   exists or the menu is not enumerated for that shape (seen on an empty
   `class X extends Y {}`). Distinguish the two in the JSON.

## Excalidraw live-browser smoke

Build an open-source live-browser smoke test for the debundler against
a Bazel-managed Excalidraw bundle. The motivation: when a debundler
issue surfaces against a private upstream corpus (proxy crash, AST
corruption, missing chunk, emit shape regression, optimisation
behaviour bug), reproducing the failure on Excalidraw lets us share
the repro in a public bug report, write a regression test that runs
in ducktape's open CI, and avoid leaking proprietary upstream bundle
detail. Excalidraw is open-source and broadly representative of "real
React + vendored chunks + dynamic imports + service worker."

### Bundle build

Use a Bazel-managed Excalidraw build. Two viable paths:

- **Pull a prebuilt deploy** (snapshot a specific `excalidraw.com`
  publish). Requires keeping the snapshot fresh enough that
  upstream's auxiliary endpoints (if any) still work. Easier to
  bootstrap.
- **Build from source under Bazel** — Excalidraw's `excalidraw-app/`
  builds with Vite; reproduce that build (npm + vite via
  aspect_rules_js, or via a `genrule` shelling to npm) and feed the
  output into the pipeline. More work upfront, but the bundle is
  reproducible from a single git pin and we control the optimisation
  level / minifier settings.

Either way, the build configuration must produce a realistic
production bundle: minify on, identifier renames,
production-tree-shaken, real chunk-split boundaries. A development
build (with un-mangled names and source maps inlined) won't exercise
the debundler's RE-relevant code paths.

### Spec scope

Not the round-trip minimum — the spec should exercise realistic-ish
module extraction and rename paths, the same shape a private-corpus
spec runs. Concretely:

- `vendor` marks with `level: swap` over a couple of
  Excalidraw's actual vendor chunks (React, Roughjs, Pointers, etc.)
  so vendor-swap edge cases (`named_from_default`,
  `named_from_module_default`, default-only, JSON-default) get covered
  on a real bundle, not only synthetic fixtures.
- `materialize_logical_modules` over a handful of pre-identified
  Excalidraw source modules — pick ones whose shape is recognisable
  in the compiled output (a clearly-bounded React component, a pure
  geometry helper, a state slice). Goal: prove the materialiser
  recovers approximately the right symbols/files from a real
  scrambled bundle.
- A small set of `logical_modules` rename entries on identifiers
  visible in the compiled output. Goal: exercise the rename pipeline
  at realistic aggressiveness.
- `emit_browser_harness`, relying on the always-on emission-time
  specifier canonicalization, so the output is a runnable app the
  live proxy can serve.

The exact module list / rename list is part of the implementation —
pick stable shapes that are unlikely to drift wildly when Excalidraw
upgrades. Stale picks become a self-test: if the materialiser fails
to find them, that's a real signal (either the bundle moved or our
matchers regressed).

### Smoke target contract

- runs `bazel test //devinfra/js/debundle/excalidraw:load_test` (or
  similar);
- builds the Excalidraw bundle through the shared `debundle_pipeline`
  rule (<pipeline.bzl>);
- starts the live-proxy binary against the resulting harness;
- drives a headless Chromium through the proxy, asserts:
  - no failed asset requests,
  - no console errors,
  - the canvas toolbar is visible (e.g. `[data-testid="toolbar"]`
    or whichever stable selector Excalidraw exposes),
  - a small interaction works (click the rectangle tool, click on
    the canvas, verify a shape was added — proves the React app is
    reactive after debundle).

### Hosting

Self-hosted, no MITM. Private-corpus smokes generally have to MITM the
live host because their auth/data is server-side; Excalidraw runs
entirely in the browser, so a self-hosted bundle is a fully working
app. Self-hosting removes the network dependency and CDN-rotation
flakiness (the test stays green even when excalidraw.com is down) and
matches the "reproduce against Excalidraw" workflow goal — a public,
deterministic smoke that doesn't depend on third-party uptime.

### Workflow rule

When a private-corpus debundler issue is tractable on Excalidraw too,
prefer landing the regression test on this Excalidraw target (or a
smaller minimised e2e under `devinfra/js/debundle/e2e/`) rather than
only fixing it behind the private repo. The latter loses the
public-CI signal and the public-bug-report leverage.

## Anonymous selector indexing in graph dumps

Today `anonymous_statements:` selectors resolve purely by AST-shape match
against the chunk's top-level statements (`match` / `source_match`); the
spec format has no owner field for them, so nothing leans on
author-provided owner hints. That keeps the format honest, but every edit
gate / coverage check touching anonymous statements has to re-parse source.

If that source resolution ever becomes too expensive, extend
`owner_graph.json` with enough machine data to resolve anonymous selectors
from the dump itself — a canonical emitted-JS string or AST fingerprint per
anonymous owner, keyed by owner id and statement ordinal — so CLI tools can
match `anonymous_statements[].match` against graph-owned statements without
reading source files. This is conditional on hitting that cost; not yet
observed.

## Multi-chunk bump aids

Only when a multi-chunk bump needs them:

- A selector that no longer matches in its chunk but matches in another gets a
  hint naming that chunk.
- A cross-chunk `same_as` relation for mirrored module trees.

## Logical materialization breadth

The current `materialize_logical_modules` covers top-level
function/class/variable declaration movement and explicit owner assignment.
Still to do:

- Full lowering matrix: binding placement reports, attached side-effects,
  staged-shell edge cases beyond the focused fixture.
- Owner-fragment modeling parity for nested declarations and re-exports.
- Keep new analysis tooling on the existing owner graph and embedded atomic
  DAG side outputs; do not add parallel selected-owner cache formats.

## Analysis semantics breadth

The focused fixtures exercise the core access model. Validate or extend
behavior for:

- Class fields, static blocks, computed keys, nested function bodies.
- Replayable side-effect attachment.
- Top-level side-effect classification across uncommon initializer shapes.

The purity-classifier backlog (cross-chunk purity facts, block-bodied
enum IIFE forms, statement-level overrides, compositional proof) lives
in <x/purity_recursive.md>.

## Corpus breadth

Current passing surface is centered on small synthetic fixtures and the
mock browser bundle. Extend to:

- Large vendor-heavy graphs.
- Unusual dynamic import forms.
- HTML/runtime asset layouts outside the current corpus.

## Rename pipeline

`lowering/rename_ledger.rs`'s module doc is the architecture reference for
the collect → seal → execute-once `RenameLedger` pipeline. Ideas it unlocked,
still open:

- **Id-keyed rename executor.** Seal output is still projected to bare
  syms (`SealedRenames::*_by_name`) because the application visitors are
  string-keyed. Deleting the projection requires (a) emitting
  import/export decls under real syntax contexts instead of
  `Ident::new_no_ctxt` — today a single rename must hit both a no-ctxt
  emitted import local and the real-ctxt body references, which only
  sym-keyed application can do — and (b) hygiene-resolving the
  `Function`-scope heuristic sources (currently keyed
  `(sym, SyntaxContext::empty())`). Until then the by-name projection is
  the executor boundary; its two-contexts-one-sym assert is the tripwire.
- **Aggressive auto-naturalization.** Now safe to build: every rename
  flows through one seal, so a new auto-naming heuristic contributor
  (readable names for still-minified bindings, driven by the
  unrenamed-symbol priority-queue side output) only needs to submit
  intents plus deriving-subtree facts — conflict resolution, occupancy,
  and capture validation come for free, and the
  renamed-it/didn't-notice miscompile class (#2045) is unrepresentable.
- **Type-level structural-move barrier.** The "no structural moves
  between seal and execute" contract is convention-held; making
  non-execute passes take `&Module` would let the compiler enforce it.

## CLI usability

Open usability and scripting-safety findings from exercising the documented
workflows against a real spec; resolved items are deleted. Corpus-specific
paths and owner ids belong in the consuming repo.

### Planner CLI follow-ups

- **Selector synthesis apply emits non-reviewable YAML churn.** The same
  downstream dogfood run applied a top-100 item batch with 75 changed
  candidates. Selector correctness looked promising, but the YAML application
  path rewrote unrelated text: 13 files changed with 7331 insertions and 4273
  deletions, one large module accounted for most churn, and an unrelated
  top-level comment was dropped. Source-aware selector synthesis needs a
  text-preserving patch path for member selector replacement and
  binding-group/member collapse before broad generated patches are reviewable.
- **Diagnostics toggle for `modules propose`.** `--limit` now bounds
  proposals and diagnostics and the `limits` summary reports totals
  when details are truncated, but there is still no explicit
  diagnostics on/off toggle for first-pass planning, where proposal
  rows are the only thing the caller wants.
- **Concise explain mode.** Proposal/diagnostic structures on
  `describe` are already opt-in (`--include-proposals`), but there is
  still no compact mode focused on: selected owner identity and source
  span, atomic-unit membership, matching proposal (if any), immediate
  constraining neighbors, and the exact reason the owner is not
  landable today.
- **Source roots.** `show-source --source-root ...` depends on the
  consuming target's source-tree layout. Runbooks and skills should make
  that target-specific root explicit instead of assuming repository root
  or working directory.
- **Patch-plan naming.** `coverage` is useful for intersecting existing
  module YAML with atomic-unit coverage, but it is not the only way to
  discover readable work: `atoms --readable-only` and `modules propose`
  may show graph-valid work even when no whole patch section is ready.
  Docs and skill text should reserve "plan" for proposed edits that can be
  reviewed/applied, and avoid implying that empty coverage output means there
  is no landable work.
