# Plan: Excalidraw live-browser smoke

Build an open-source live-browser smoke test for the debundler against
a Bazel-managed Excalidraw bundle. The motivation: when a debundler
issue surfaces against a private upstream corpus (proxy crash, AST
corruption, missing chunk, emit shape regression, optimisation
behaviour bug), reproducing the failure on Excalidraw lets us share
the repro in a public bug report, write a regression test that runs
in ducktape's open CI, and avoid leaking proprietary upstream bundle
detail. Excalidraw is open-source and broadly representative of "real
React + vendored chunks + dynamic imports + service worker."

## Bundle build

Use a Bazel-managed Excalidraw build. Two viable paths:

- **Pull a prebuilt deploy** (snapshot a specific `excalidraw.com`
  publish). Requires keeping the snapshot fresh enough that
  upstream's auxiliary endpoints (if any) still work. Easier to
  bootstrap.
- **Build from source under Bazel** — Excalidraw's `excalidraw-app/`
  builds with Vite; reproduce that build (npm + vite via
  aspect_rules_js, or via a `genrule` shelling to npm) and feed the
  output into the pipeline. More work upfront, but the bundle is
  reproducible from a single git pin and we control the optimisation
  level / minifier settings.

Either way, the build configuration must produce a realistic
production bundle: minify on, identifier renames,
production-tree-shaken, real chunk-split boundaries. A development
build (with un-mangled names and source maps inlined) won't exercise
the debundler's RE-relevant code paths.

## Spec scope

Not the round-trip minimum — the spec should exercise realistic-ish
module extraction and rename paths, the same shape a private-corpus
spec runs. Concretely:

- `vendor` marks with `level: swap` over a couple of
  Excalidraw's actual vendor chunks (React, Roughjs, Pointers, etc.)
  so vendor-swap edge cases (`named_from_default`,
  `named_from_module_default`, default-only, JSON-default) get covered
  on a real bundle, not only synthetic fixtures.
- `materialize_logical_modules` over a handful of pre-identified
  Excalidraw source modules — pick ones whose shape is recognisable
  in the compiled output (a clearly-bounded React component, a pure
  geometry helper, a state slice). Goal: prove the materialiser
  recovers approximately the right symbols/files from a real
  scrambled bundle.
- A small set of `logical_modules` rename entries on identifiers
  visible in the compiled output. Goal: exercise the rename pipeline
  at realistic aggressiveness.
- `emit_browser_harness`, relying on the always-on emission-time
  specifier canonicalization, so the output is a runnable app the
  live proxy can serve.

The exact module list / rename list is part of the implementation —
pick stable shapes that are unlikely to drift wildly when Excalidraw
upgrades. Stale picks become a self-test: if the materialiser fails
to find them, that's a real signal (either the bundle moved or our
matchers regressed).

## Smoke target contract

- runs `bazel test //devinfra/js/debundle/excalidraw:load_test` (or
  similar);
- builds the Excalidraw bundle through the shared `debundle_pipeline`
  rule (<../pipeline.bzl>);
- starts the live-proxy binary against the resulting harness;
- drives a headless Chromium through the proxy, asserts:
  - no failed asset requests,
  - no console errors,
  - the canvas toolbar is visible (e.g. `[data-testid="toolbar"]`
    or whichever stable selector Excalidraw exposes),
  - a small interaction works (click the rectangle tool, click on
    the canvas, verify a shape was added — proves the React app is
    reactive after debundle).

## Hosting

Self-hosted, no MITM. Private-corpus smokes generally have to MITM the
live host because their auth/data is server-side; Excalidraw runs
entirely in the browser, so a self-hosted bundle is a fully working
app. Self-hosting removes the network dependency and CDN-rotation
flakiness (the test stays green even when excalidraw.com is down) and
matches the "reproduce against Excalidraw" workflow goal — a public,
deterministic smoke that doesn't depend on third-party uptime.

## Workflow rule

When a private-corpus debundler issue is tractable on Excalidraw too,
prefer landing the regression test on this Excalidraw target (or a
smaller minimised e2e under `devinfra/js/debundle/e2e/`) rather than
only fixing it behind the private repo. The latter loses the
public-CI signal and the public-bug-report leverage.
