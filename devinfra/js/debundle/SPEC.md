# Selector resolution: specification

What `debundle` guarantees when it places spec entities in a bundle chunk. How to
write selectors: <docs/selectors.md>. How it is implemented:
<docs/selector_resolution.md>.

## Entities

An **entity** is one thing a spec places in a chunk: a module member, a
`source_matches[].bindings[]` entry, or an `anonymous_statements[]` entry. Each
entity's selector names the places it may occupy: a top-level declaration (by the
minified binding it declares) or one top-level statement.

An entity is scoped to its module's chunk, and only that chunk's places are its
candidates. In a tree spec, each module tree names the chunk its modules are
scoped to; several trees may name the same chunk, and their modules then share
it as if authored in one tree.

## Matching

Only the shape matcher decides where a `source_match` template matches. A
template matches a place when their syntax trees are equal up to:

- **holes** — `ANYTHING`, `EXPR`, `STMT`, `STMT_LIST`, `DECLARATORS` and the other
  hole keywords of <docs/selectors.md> match any subtree of their kind;
- **alpha-renaming** — binding and value identifiers match any identifier,
  consistently within their lexical scope.

A **free** identifier, one the template uses but never declares, is not always
alpha-renamed. In order, it is:

1. a hole keyword;
2. a **reference** to the spec entity exported under that name: by the
   template's own module if it exports one, else by the one other module that
   does. A name several other modules export makes the template `invalid`;
3. an unshadowed **global** (`Object`, `window`, `console`, …) if the chunk
   neither declares nor imports that name at top level: it matches only itself;
4. otherwise alpha-renamed.

A place matches a reference only where the free name binds, throughout the
match, the one chunk identifier the referenced entity takes, whichever selector
pins that entity. A reference to an entity whose own selector fails before the
joint solve (`no_match`, `too_broad`, `invalid`) alpha-renames.

A `source_matches[]` binding may claim a free identifier of its template
instead of a declaration (**pinning by use site**). Its entity is the top-level
declaration that identifier binds to, throughout the match; a match where it
binds no top-level declaration, or different identifiers in different scopes,
is not a place of that entity. A claimed free identifier is the entity's own
binding, never a reference or a global. A claim of free identifiers only does
not claim the matched statement.

An anonymous statement written with a bare `match:` rather than `source_match:`
skips alpha-renaming: its identifiers must equal the chunk's. Literals,
operators, member property names, object keys and tree structure are
significant. Relational selectors (`cross_ref`, `reads_member`, …) match through
facts derived from the chunk, not through templates.

## Assignment

Every chunk's entities form one program. Each entity takes exactly one of its
matched places, jointly with every other entity:

- no two entities claim the same place, whichever modules or trees they come
  from;
- a relational selector holds between the places its entities take;
- a template's references agree with the places their entities take.

The answer is the **unique** assignment satisfying these. An assignment that
holds only for some solutions of the joint problem is not an answer.

## Outcomes

Every entity gets exactly one outcome, in one record format shared by `run`,
`spec validate` and `spec match-selector`:

| Outcome                                   | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                    | Severity |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| `resolved`, `resolved_by: own_selector`   | its selector alone matches one place                                                                                                                                                       | ok       |
| `resolved`, `resolved_by: own_references` | several places match its selector; only one agrees with the places of the `references` it names                                                                                            | ok       |
| `resolved`, `resolved_by: elimination`    | unique only because the named `claimers` took its other places                                                                                                                             | warning  |
| `resolved`, `resolved_by: referenced_by`  | its selector matches several places; the templates of the named `referrers`, which name it, pick one                                                                                       | warning  |
| `no_match`                                | no place satisfies its selector and constraints; a one-statement template may list up to 3 `nearest_unclaimed` statements (no entity claims them), closest first, with where each diverges | error    |
| `ambiguous`                               | several assignments exist; at most 5 of its places are listed, with `truncated` when more exist                                                                                            | error    |
| `conflict`                                | no assignment exists; `with` names the entities of an unsatisfiable set (not necessarily minimal)                                                                                          | error    |
| `too_broad`                               | its selector matches more than 100 places, and it takes no further part                                                                                                                    | error    |
| `duplicate_claim`                         | resolved to a binding another entity already claims; `declaration` gives the statement declaring it (`owner`, its body index) and its keyword `kind` (`function`, `const`, `import`, ...)  | error    |
| `invalid`                                 | its selector does not parse, uses an unsupported construct, or its matches do not map to places                                                                                            | error    |
| `undecided`                               | the solver stopped before deciding it                                                                                                                                                      | error    |

A contradiction affects only the entities in it: the others still resolve.

`run` and `spec validate` in both modes give each entity the same outcome. The
edit gate and `describe` resolve only `source_matches[]` entries and anonymous
statements, without the spec's other members, and give those entities the same
outcome except that one unique only because a relational member claimed its
other places is `ambiguous` to them, and a template reference to any other
member alpha-renames there. Only the pipeline
(`run`, `spec validate --spec`) reports `duplicate_claim`. `spec match-selector`
resolves its selector as a spec of one entity, so a selector resolved by
elimination or by its references in a spec is `ambiguous` there.

## Modes

- **Keep-going** (the default): every outcome is reported, entities with an
  error outcome stay unclaimed, and a chunk with any error outcome fails once
  all of its outcomes are reported. Every chunk is reported; the run fails
  with the first failing chunk in chunk-id order.
- **Fail-fast** (`--fail-fast`): the first error outcome stops the run. Outcomes
  come in a fixed order: every chunk's duplicate claims, then every chunk's
  resolved outcomes, chunks in chunk-id order.

Warnings never stop a run.
