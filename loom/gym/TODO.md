# loom/gym TODO

- **Rename `baseline_llm.py`.** Once the bare one-shot LLM scaffold is gone, the
  module is purely the shared answer-schema + parse library (`question_schema`,
  `answer_instruction`, `parse_answer`, the per-question input models) — the name
  `baseline_llm` no longer describes it. Rename to something like `answer_schema.py`
  and update importers (`inspect_harness.py`, tests, BUILD).
