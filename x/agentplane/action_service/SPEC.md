# Action Service

The service owns durable ActionRequests, Decisions, and single-shot Executions. Authenticated
callers see only their own requests; the separate operator interface can review and decide them.
Caller-provided provenance never assigns authority. Retry with the same caller-scoped idempotency
key recovers the same request, not another execution.

## Bounded receipt waits

A receipt wait can return immediately or wait up to 30 seconds for either a resolved Decision or
an Execution outcome. Allowed but undispatched/running work satisfies the Decision predicate only.
Denied, cancelled, succeeded, failed, and execution-unknown receipts satisfy both predicates.
Execution-unknown is a returnable outcome, not proof of success or permission to replay.

Waits use pushed committed-state invalidations, including updates written by another process.
The durable receipt remains authoritative; duplicate/coalesced notifications do not manufacture
transitions. Setup cannot miss a concurrent commit. A deadline returns the current receipt, while
disconnect or wait cancellation only releases the wait and never cancels or resubmits the Action.
Loss of the notification channel fails waiting explicitly; immediate reads remain available and
there is no periodic state-query fallback.
