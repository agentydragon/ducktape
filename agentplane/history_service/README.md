# History Service

Serves retained Session history: the raw runner Event log and its observation metadata, keyed by
public Session ID. It authenticates callers by projected ServiceAccount token (TokenReview) and
serves only the configured reader accounts, today the integration app's. A Session UUID by itself
grants nothing. Consumers use `client.py`; `testing/backend.py` serves the real boundary over a test
database.

Today the Sandbox Service still writes the history tables and runs their migrations. This service
reads them, in read-only transactions, through `sandbox_service/session_history`. Target and sequence:
[History Service plan](../plans/history_service.md).

Bazel targets: `:main`, `:image`. Settings come from `AGENTPLANE_HISTORY_SERVICE_*` environment
variables or the YAML file named by `AGENTPLANE_HISTORY_SERVICE_CONFIG_FILE` (`settings.py`). gRPC
listens on `port`, and `/healthz` on `health_port` reports process liveness only.
