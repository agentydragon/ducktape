# Model-roster migration inventory

Companion to the [design](design.md). This records files and consumers requiring
review, not a commitment to change every file. **Only explicitly approved dispositions
are decisions**; all other keep/move/merge/delete options remain open.
The [tracking issue](https://github.com/agentydragon/ducktape/issues/9574) owns PR/rollout
status and links to the historical parked-integration inventory in
[#9121](https://github.com/agentydragon/ducktape/issues/9121).

## Consumer inventory and side effects

Before deletion or renaming, check these as well as the obvious clients:

- Terraform virtual-key allowlists, team fallback order, and experiment keys.
- Agentplane picker/default selections, LLM ingress metadata/auth routing, and
  runner environment/guest configuration. These are not interchangeable registries.
- Hidden Codex recognition aliases and the public embedding compatibility alias.
- OpenClaw durable memory: stored embedding identities can outlive a running agent.
  Pausing the app is not permission to delete/rebuild its index or change its model.
- Parked Haku OpenClaw's native CLI model aliases, Gatus's selected Ollama probe,
  inference/probe scripts, and live harness acceptance cases.
- Nix wrapper JSON, binaries, imports, and credential provisioning. Moving a source
  file to `x/` alone does not stop deploying its generated outputs.
- LiteLLM pricing/budget accounting and telemetry labels. Route cleanup must not
  accidentally bypass spending limits or relabel unrelated account costs.

This is a starting inventory, not a claim of exhaustive runtime reachability.
Repository references and operator confirmation are both needed.

### Files requiring disposition decisions

**Dispositions are OPEN unless explicitly marked approved below.** This is a review
inventory, not an approved
keep/move/merge/delete list or a promise that every file needs a diff. Paths are the
current locations; grouped paths do not imply that their fates must be the same.
For each, trace its declarations, inputs, outputs and actual readers; then record the
chosen disposition and rationale when agreed. Unchanged, simplified, moved, consolidated
or removed are possible outcomes, subject to the existing constraints. The previously
suggested fates are candidates, not commitments. Extend the inventory if the audit
finds another consumer or source of independently maintained configuration.

#### Neutral definitions and policy

| Current file                | Question to resolve                                                                                                                                                                  |

| `model_catalog/BUILD.bazel` | What dependency and visibility changes follow from the chosen ownership, while keeping Nix and runtime consumers independent of cdk8s internals?                                     |

#### Agentplane selection, projection and runtime

The settled boundaries are:

- `cluster/cdk8s/agentplane/app_settings.py` projects named selections into the app's
  existing offering schema. Environments supply those selections at the renderer;
  `Environment` does not carry an unused `model_routes` field.
- `cluster/cdk8s/agentplane/llm_ingress.py` projects selected routes and explicit
  `RUNNER_CONTEXT_OVERRIDES` into ingress-owned configuration, not runner environment
  or guest-config budget maps. `agentplane/llm_ingress/models.py` owns the shared
  `ModelConfig` contract; `settings.py` owns ingress configuration.
- `agentplane/runner/model_config.py` performs the authenticated lookup. Runner
  configuration selects the harness endpoint/credential, and session handling applies
  the resolved budget in the native adapter's vocabulary. The
  [client-budget description](client_budgets.md#codex-and-agentplane) owns these semantics.

Source disposition and remaining work:

| Files / boundary                                                                   | Disposition / remaining question                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cluster/cdk8s/model_selections.py`; Agentplane environment and preset definitions | Reviewed 2026-10-10: retain named-route offerings and explicit preset defaults. Staging/testing public-coder defaults select Luna; Haku selects Qwen 256K. No reconstructed default slugs or second roster found. |
| Ingress `app.py`, `settings.py`; runner lookup and session handling                | Should exposed model IDs differ from LiteLLM IDs? Translation remains a TODO, not an implemented or activated mapping. Coordinate request/response identity, authorization and accounting.                        |

Runtime acceptance remains open: verify new-runner startup/session/model-switch
behavior and existing-runner inference/stream continuity. Source wiring and template
inspection do not establish those outcomes; the tracker owns the dated evidence.

#### Nix wrappers and direct local clients

Source review: **retain the current boundary**, not another wrapper migration.
`model_catalog/nix.py` owns wrapper route selections and client budgets, validates
primary/Haiku membership in the key lane, and emits `claude-wrappers.json`.
`nix/home/claude_code/gateway.nix` renders that data into environment/exec settings;
individual wrappers retain family-specific behavior, not duplicate rosters.
The JSON remains generated, not another authored model registry.

`nix/home/home.nix` explicitly pauses gateway wrapper installation. Keep the
renderers, secrets and direct Codex/Claude modules; no centralized-gateway migration
or reactivation is implied. Source review does not verify workstation activation
or the current behavior of installed clients (#9112).

#### Ollama serving variants

#### Public Coder and smaller consumers

Reviewed 2026-10-10; no structural rewrite justified:

- `cluster/cdk8s/public_coder/config.py` owns the paused OpenClaw client's named
  route selections, labels and explicit context/output budgets. `app.py` serializes
  that config; workload, egress, devbox and backup modules are not model rosters.
  Keep the renderer and embedding route identity. The current default is GPT-6
  Luna, not a capacity measurement; the stale “measured 5.6” comment is corrected.
- `cluster/cdk8s/parked/haku_openclaw_spike_config.py` selects named Claude
  subscription routes and renders native Claude CLI IDs intentionally, not LiteLLM
  routing IDs. Retain its aliases, runtime/auth wiring and revival information.
- `cluster/cdk8s/gatus/config.py` selects the named GPT-OSS 20B 128K route for its
  probe. It does not reconstruct route slugs or maintain a second model catalogue.
- `model_catalog/policies.py` owns key lanes and fallback subsets;
  `cluster/cdk8s/litellm/keys.py` serializes them, and Terraform owns explicit
  key/team/accounting bindings. Combining lanes is authorization policy, not
  duplicate model identity. Keep these boundaries.

Existing roster, Nix, key-policy and OpenClaw tests check identity, authorization,
serialization and native-consumer assumptions. Preserve them; do not add tests that
merely copy the roster constants. This is source-disposition review, **not** live
startup/model-switch acceptance, pause verification, storage cleanup or permission
to restore consumers. Those operational obligations remain in #9574.

See [documentation consolidation](#documentation-ownership); preserve evidence and restoration instructions. |

### Approved file disposition: cross-layer harness audit

**Previously approved and implemented:** moved
`agentplane/docs/model_metadata.md` to
[`model_catalog/debug/harness_model_metadata.md`](debug/harness_model_metadata.md).
Its LiteLLM naming/authorization, Nix-wrapper and native-client findings span consumers;
Agentplane supplied the capture machinery but does not own all those findings. Preserve
the historical versions and evidence, update relative links, and link from Agentplane's
capture documentation rather than keeping a duplicate or redirect stub. Capture tools
and runtime code stay in Agentplane. This decision does not settle any other file's fate.

## Token metadata ownership migration

**Agreed target:** every retained served route gets its applicable token metadata from
Ducktape declarations. LiteLLM catalogue values may be copied with entry/revision
provenance; live fallback is not the long-term authority. Legacy schema aliases are
projected from the same declaration, not independent facts. Fresh probing of every model
is not required. This does not reopen consumer-budget ownership or authorize route removal.

**Source snapshot, reconciled 2026-10-10:** 58 of 74 public entries publish explicit
metadata: 54 generative pairs and four embedding input-only declarations. This is
publication coverage, not a percentage of programme completion or validated capacity.
The six ChatGPT entries below count as published despite their provisional provenance.
GPT-5.6 Sol/Terra/Luna have been removed from both ChatGPT wires and derived key
allowlists; GPT-6 selections and consumer budgets are unchanged.

Direct-provider chat, Antigravity text, the refreshed Claude subscription roster and
embedding declarations have landed. The three larger GPT-OSS OpenAI exposures and
three Tana routes are parked; their restoration constraints below remain in force.
The tracker retains the PR ledger and dated rollout evidence rather than repeating
successive implementation/CI states here.

These are **remaining data/disposition decisions**, not a second runtime registry.
The `publish_limits` flag remains transitional until retained declarations and
mode-appropriate publication rules are complete. Metadata research does not block
behavior-preserving consumer simplification. The tracker owns lane ordering and
current PR/rollout status; this inventory owns unresolved file/data decisions.

### Parked GPT-OSS 20B OpenAI exposures

Approved 2026-10-09: remove only `ollama/oai-chat/gpt-oss-20b-{256k,512k,1m}`
from serving, derived key allowlists, and Agentplane staging/testing offerings.
Those exposures used the base `gpt-oss:20b` tag without baked-context aliases;
Ollama's OpenAI-compatible endpoint ignores native `options.num_ctx`.

Retain all three `ollama/olm-chat/` counterparts with their explicit request options,
both 128K wires, other models, existing fallback/default choices, and the unchanged
Ollama provisioning code, models and storage. This removes exposures, not stored
state or the ability to make native requests. Existing sessions configured to use a
parked route will need a retained compatible route after rollout; there is no silent
rerouting to the base model or to the native wire.

To restore: deliberately provision/select appropriate baked tags (or another proven
OpenAI-compatible context-selection mechanism), verify the effective serving path,
then restore the selected exposures in `catalog.py` and regenerate consumers. A tag
name or successful oversized request is not capacity proof. No alias provisioning,
model pruning, client-budget increase or automatic unpause is approved by this change.
[#9574](https://github.com/agentydragon/ducktape/issues/9574) tracks source/rollout status.

## Documentation ownership

Retain [`cluster/docs/model_catalog.md`](../cluster/docs/model_catalog.md) as the
cluster wiring and operations guide. It owns deployment bindings, projection and
regeneration entry points, and cluster-specific pause/restoration instructions.
Neutral model semantics stay outside `cluster/`; the guide links to them rather than
maintaining a second specification.

Update affected wiring descriptions with implementation changes. Remove resolved
alternatives and completed instructions instead of appending migration histories;
preserve useful evidence and restoration requirements. Remaining metadata decisions,
consumer dispositions and runtime acceptance are not closed by documentation cleanup.

### Tana exposure parked (2026-10-09)

Tana is a reverse-engineered gateway with unknown limits; vendor model names are
not evidence of equivalent capacity. Temporarily omit its three routes from the
served roster rather than invent metadata. The Tana key lane/fallback and generated
Claude wrapper selection are removed together. The dedicated client key and team
are removed from Terraform; the client key revocation and successful reconciliation
were verified, but this is not a claim that every historical same-alias team was deleted.
Key/team identity and accounting continuity are not preserved. Their encrypted
credential files, backend credentials, gateway implementation/registration,
wrapper renderer and stored application data remain; no deployment is paused or deleted.

The initial blocked-key approach in #9587 applied the block and cleared the team
fallback, but Terraform failed to converge: the provider rewrites `models = []`
for a team-associated key to `["all-team-models"]`, contradicting the planned empty
list. Removing the unused key/team avoids that provider mismatch without unblocking
or manually editing Terraform state.

[Operator verification after #9592](https://github.com/agentydragon/ducktape/issues/9574#issuecomment-6082223649)
confirmed successful Terraform apply at `6599c2eb1ecfc1477dea10dc271ac36981dbdaa4`
and zero `tana-clients` keys. The subsequent operator-provided query showed four
older same-alias teams with no attached keys or projects, still carrying old
fallbacks. They remain a separate cleanup decision: these counts do not establish
all dependencies or authorize deletion by alias. Do not keep the completed key
revocation open waiting for unrelated historical-row cleanup.

TODO(#9574): before re-enabling, review whether the gateway can support defensible
metadata (or explicitly accept unknown limits), restore the served routes and
consumer selections, and recreate the client key/team with a reviewed allowlist
and fallback. Retained encrypted key material alone does not authorize access.
No inference or capacity testing was performed as part of parking.
